# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Auto-Categorizer is an intelligent system that automatically categorizes financial transactions using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This feature will analyze transaction descriptions, amounts, dates, and historical patterns to suggest appropriate categories to imported transactions, significantly reducing manual categorization work while maintaining high accuracy through human-in-the-loop approval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a financial manager, I want transactions to receive AI-powered categorization suggestions so that I can quickly review and approve appropriate categories with minimal manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is imported THEN the system SHALL analyze the transaction using AI models
2. WHEN the AI generates a suggestion THEN the system SHALL create a categorization suggestion for user review
3. WHEN multiple transactions have similar patterns THEN the system SHALL provide consistent categorization suggestions
4. WHEN a suggestion is generated THEN the system SHALL provide reasoning for why the category was suggested
5. WHEN I review suggestions THEN the system SHALL present them in an easy-to-approve interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a financial manager, I want the AI to learn from my categorization patterns so that it becomes more accurate over time for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I manually categorize a transaction THEN the system SHALL use this as training data for future predictions
2. WHEN I correct an AI categorization THEN the system SHALL update its model to avoid similar mistakes
3. WHEN the system has processed 100+ transactions THEN it SHALL show improved accuracy metrics
4. WHEN I approve AI suggestions THEN the system SHALL reinforce those categorization patterns
5. WHEN similar transactions are processed THEN the system SHALL apply learned patterns with higher confidence

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a financial manager, I want to see AI categorization insights and performance metrics so that I can understand and trust the system's suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view categorization reports THEN the system SHALL show AI suggestion accuracy metrics over time
2. WHEN I review a transaction THEN the system SHALL display the reasoning behind the AI suggestion
3. WHEN I access AI insights THEN the system SHALL show which transaction patterns are most commonly suggested
4. WHEN I disagree with a suggestion THEN the system SHALL learn from my correction for future similar transactions
5. WHEN I view monthly reports THEN the system SHALL show percentage of transactions with AI suggestions vs rule-based suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a financial manager, I want the AI to handle complex transaction scenarios so that even unusual or multi-part transactions can be properly categorized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction has multiple components (fees, taxes, principal) THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate split categorization
2. WHEN a transaction is a transfer between accounts THEN the system SHALL identify it as a transfer and not an expense/income
3. WHEN a transaction is recurring (rent, utilities) THEN the system SHALL recognize the pattern and categorize consistently
4. WHEN a transaction description is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL use amount patterns and historical context for categorization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a financial manager, I want the AI suggestions to integrate seamlessly with existing rule-based systems so that I can benefit from both approaches in the suggestion interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both AI and rules generate suggestions THEN the system SHALL show both suggestions with clear source identification
2. WHEN rules fail to match THEN the system SHALL show AI suggestions as the primary option
3. WHEN AI and rules conflict THEN the system SHALL present both options for user choice
4. WHEN I approve an AI suggestion THEN the system SHALL use this as training data for future suggestions
5. WHEN I create a new rule THEN the system SHALL incorporate rule patterns into AI training data
