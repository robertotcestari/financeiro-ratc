# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OFX Importer feature will enable users to import financial transaction data from OFX (Open Financial Exchange) files into the financial management system. OFX is a widely-used standard format for exchanging financial data between financial institutions and personal finance software. This feature will streamline the process of importing bank statements, credit card transactions, and investment data, reducing manual data entry and improving data accuracy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload OFX files from my bank or financial institution, so that I can automatically import my transaction data without manual entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an OFX file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure
2. WHEN an OFX file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL parse the file and extract transaction data
3. WHEN the file parsing is successful THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the transactions to be imported
4. IF the OFX file is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the user confirms the import THEN the system SHALL save the transactions to the database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually select which bank account to associate with my OFX file, so that I have full control over where imported transactions are assigned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading an OFX file THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select which bank account the transactions belong to
2. WHEN selecting an account THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown of all available bank accounts
3. IF the user needs a new account THEN the system SHALL provide an option to create a new bank account
4. WHEN the user selects an account THEN the system SHALL use that account for all transactions in the OFX file
5. WHEN the account is selected THEN the system SHALL proceed to the import preview with the chosen account mapping

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to avoid importing duplicate transactions, so that my financial data remains accurate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing transactions THEN the system SHALL check for existing transactions with matching date, amount, and description
2. IF potential duplicates are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight them in the preview
3. WHEN duplicates are found THEN the system SHALL allow the user to choose whether to skip or import them
4. WHEN the user chooses to skip duplicates THEN the system SHALL exclude them from the import
5. WHEN the import is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary showing imported and skipped transactions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want imported transactions to be automatically categorized when possible, so that I can maintain organized financial records with minimal manual work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing transactions THEN the system SHALL attempt to categorize them based on existing categorization rules
2. IF a transaction matches an existing category pattern THEN the system SHALL assign that category
3. WHEN transactions cannot be automatically categorized THEN the system SHALL leave them uncategorized for manual review
4. WHEN the import preview is shown THEN the system SHALL display the proposed categories for user review
5. WHEN the user modifies categories in the preview THEN the system SHALL use the updated categories for import

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a detailed import summary, so that I can verify what data was imported and identify any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an import is completed THEN the system SHALL display a summary report
2. WHEN displaying the summary THEN the system SHALL show the number of transactions imported, skipped, and failed
3. IF any transactions failed to import THEN the system SHALL list the specific errors and affected transactions
4. WHEN the summary is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide options to view the imported transactions
5. WHEN errors occur during import THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to handle different OFX file versions and formats, so that I can import data from various financial institutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing OFX files THEN the system SHALL support both OFX 1.x (SGML) and OFX 2.x (XML) formats
2. WHEN encountering different OFX versions THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and parse the appropriate format
3. IF an unsupported OFX version is encountered THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN parsing OFX data THEN the system SHALL handle common variations in field names and structures
5. WHEN institution-specific formatting is detected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate parsing rules
