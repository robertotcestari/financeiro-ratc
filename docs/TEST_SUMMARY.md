## Test Technologies Used

- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **Jest DOM**: DOM assertion matchers
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking
- **TypeScript**: Type safety in tests

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:run

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Configuration

The test setup includes:
- JSDoc environment for React component tests
- Mock implementations for Prisma database client
- Next.js specific mocking (cache, server functions)
- Brazilian locale formatting validation

## Mock Strategy

### Database Mocking
- Prisma client operations are mocked
- CRUD operations return realistic data structures
- Error scenarios are properly simulated

### External Dependencies
- Next.js cache functions
- File system operations
- Currency/date formatting libraries

## Quality Assurance

The test suite ensures:
- **Functionality**: All core features work as expected
- **Reliability**: Edge cases and error scenarios are handled
- **Maintainability**: Tests are well-structured and documented
- **Performance**: Tests run efficiently with proper mocking
- **Accessibility**: UI components meet accessibility standards

## Future Test Enhancements

Potential areas for expanded test coverage:
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Visual regression testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Security testing for financial data handling

This comprehensive test suite provides confidence in the application's reliability and helps maintain code quality as the project evolves.
